Understand the problem:
1. Digest the problem. Don't rush. Read carefully. Our brain fills in gaps if we don't do it explicity.

2. Write out the Inputs and Outputs including the implicit ones; write out implicit concepts as well
**Problem domain is the area of expertise or application that needs to be examined to solve a problem.
It limits the scope of the problem.**

3. Write out the rules
What are the rules or the constraints that we need to consider?
Write out defaults (if there are any).
4. Write out claifactory questions?

Mental model:
A mental model is an explanation of someone's thought process about how something
works in the real world.
Divide it into parts.

Examples/Test Cases:
1. To validate our problem check on what is the expected output
If I follow this rule what is the output?

Data Structure:
This is the data structure that we will work with to convert the input to output
How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output: classes, variables, strings, integers
methods, different datatypes
DSata structure and algorithm go hand in hand

Algorithm:
Coming up with a series of instructions that will take us from the input to the output
Lose  flexibility if written in programming language construct (i.e., use a for loop, use each, etc)
Change has to be done to algorithm if there are changes realized during implementation

One promblem -> multipe agorithms

Where to start?
If you've got a mental model you can start from there; otherwise you can start with the data structure
