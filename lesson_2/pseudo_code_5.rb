# a method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result ofmerging the 
# arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes
# indexes of the returned array while the elements of the second array should become the 
# elements at the odd indices 

=begin
Assign a variable an empty array
Iterate through the first array
iterate through the indices of the empty array
if the indices of the empty array are even
Append values of the first array to the empty array
else
Append the values of the second array
